The "ConicsGenerator.txt" file generates the equations of 27 osculating conics using the group generators g_0,g_1,g_2 described in the paper. In this file the variables z_1,z_2,z_3 and t are treated as parameters.

The "Exponents***.txt" files determine degrees of the syzygies for various t, corresponding to the curves discussed in Chapter 4 of the paper.

All files are compatible with version 4.4.0 of the Singular software.
